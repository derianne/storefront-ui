/**
 * Problems:
 *
 * Following use case is interesting:
 *
 * Let's imagine we close accordion in smart column so that it becomes half of its height (and its height will be smaller than viewport height).
 * 1) if we keep stickiness as bottom ({ position: sticky, bottom: 0 }), it will stick to bottom which is obviously stupid (if less than viewport, should stick to top)
 * 2) if we keep stickiness as top  ({ position: sticky, top: -500px }), it will have bad state. It means it will be partly visible although it should be fully visible.
 *
 * Getting reasonable listener on content resize seems not very possible (ResizeListener almost totally not compatible with browsers).
 * This leaves us only with CSS and static approach. Especially because height (accordion anim) might be animated (a lot of events / performance).
 *
 * Finding solution which handles smooth change + good performance is impssible, actually this "smart scrolling" should be implemented by browser vendors (double ended sticky!)
 *
 * Best solution which avoids "jitters" and is most reasonable is:
 * 1) use (2)
 * 2) AS A GUIDELINE: do not create huge accordions etc. It shouldn't be possible to decrease smart column content height by A LOT.
 *
 * Solution (1) would be better if we KNOW that smart content is long enough it will never be higher than viewport.
 *
 * We could keep both strategies possible as an option.
 *
 *
 *
 * -----
 *
 * FUCK
 *
 * When you remove content, it works. But when you ADD content, top: VAL when scrolling down should be recalculated!!!!! :( :( :(
 *
 * Well, we should remember size. And onscroll, if size changed, we should adjust.
 *
 * But animations will suck!!!! We'd adjust on every scroll this is terrible.
 *
 * This happens ONLY when content is once smaller, once bigger than viewport. What about min-height: 100%???
 *
 * Well, not very possible because if content is 50vh, then at the bottom there's gonna be empty space.
 *
 *
 * What if:
 *
 * - there's a column and it's position: sticky.
 * - there's a content wrapper in column with min-height: 100%;
 * - the content IN this wrapper is ALSO position: sticky top: 0; -> this one would prevent stupid effect at the bottom

 +----------------------------------+



 *
 * A lot of traumatic thoughts related to this component, but I'd like to make some summary.
 *
 * First, requirements of good UX (ALL of them).
 * 1. Double sticky behaviour must be correct (that's a foundation).
 * 2. When you "uncollapse content" inside the column, it should uncollapse DOWN, unless there's no space.
 * 3. When you "collapse content" inside the column, it should collapse UP (there's always a space).
 * 4. When you "collapse content" inside the column, and it becomes less than 100vh high, it should snap to the viewport,
 *    so that it is visible. This means that content less than 100vh high should always be fully visible. In all cases.
 * 5. When you "uncollapse content" inside the column and you're at the bottom of the container, it should uncollapse UP.
 *    Content can't never stick out of container unless it's higher than container.
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1. Solution with margin-top / margin-bottom is nice, but it doesn't work with (5). margin is "height creator" and column
 *    might be higher than container even if it isn't. Solution could be min-height.
 * 2. min-height is nice but min-height + flex-end makes content always grow up, which usually breaks (2).
 * 3. flexbox is not a help (top filler and bottom filler with good flex-grow / flex-shrink). It would require setting
 *    flex-basis on some filler in pixels and it also creates height.
 * 4. bottom: 0 with min-height usually means breaking (2).
 * 5. top: -X always is good for (2) but breaks (4)
 *
 *
 * Solutions and approaches we took during development:
 * 1. First was very simple. When you scroll down, you get bottom: 0 and margin-top. When you scroll up, other way round.
 *    This didn't work well, it breaks (5). margin is height creator so column seemed higher than it really was. It could
 *    easily get higher than continer and stick out of container.
 *    Also, if margin-bottom was set (for top: 0), (2) was broken.
 *    Also, (4) could be broken too during resizing.
 * 2. min-height came for the rescue. It didn't create height and behaved properly, didn't break (5).
 *    However, (2) and (4) could still happen.
 * 3. To fix (4), we thought that we could use min-height: 100vh content box and inline another sticky there.
 *    Namely, {position: sticky; top: 0}.
 *    THIS IS IMPORTANT
 *    Having content in min-height: 100vh container with sticky-top0 and this container having
 *    sticky-top0 or sticky-bottom0 gives us 100%-certainty that (4) won't be broken.
 *    We COULD achieve good effect with only-sticky-top or only-sticky-bottom behaviour but this forces us
 *    to use top or bottom which are non-zero. For example stickiness when scrolling down is possible
 *    only with negative top value.
 *    It means that when content is resized, this top/bottom value should be updated. This forces us to
 *    relayout every frame (on resize animation) and that SUCKS.
 *    Conclusion is that we MUST use only bottom: 0 and top: 0 for stickiness, can't use non-zero values.
 * 4. There's a neat trick achieving (1) easily:
 *    We can create outer container with flex-end and bottom: 0 (min-height: height + top margin) and
 *    inner container with flex-start and top: 0.
 *    This solves all except for (2). In many cases content will unroll UP.
 * 5. We can also turn around above solution and use outer container with flex-start an top: 0,
 *    inner with flex-end and bottom: 0. But sadly, we must also add another sticky inside with top: 0,
 *    because content < 100vh would stick to bottom. sticky in sticky in sticky -> yeah.
 * 6. IMPORTANT.
 *    The position of column relative to the container changes as we scroll.
 *    position: sticky is responsible for keeping column in good position (and satisfying requirement (1)).
 *    But!
 *    as we scroll, min-height is not updated.
 *    We could update min-height:
 *    1. on every scroll
 *    2. on every resize (ResizeObserver polyfill).
 *    3. on scroll stop (detect 100-200ms of "not scrolling").
 *    4. on scroll direction change.
 *    Resizing (when animated) and scrolling is not a good moment to update min-height.
 *    It's because it would require re-layout every frame.
 *    This re-layout on my Mac is not heavy (~2ms Chrome), FF and Safari also seems fast.
 *    But still. We shouldn't take so much of a frame time for ourselves.
 *    Resizing on scroll stop makes sense. User usually won't make an action BEFORE
 *    200ms pass after stopping scrolling. It's too fast. That means that update won't happen
 *    during animation or during scroll.
 *    Ofc, it's still possible that they'll interfere but it will be quite rare.
 *
 *    Why it's important to update min-height? Let's get to next point.
 *
 * 7. Scenarios 4. and 5. are good but how do they deal with (2) requirement?
 *    Well, it depenends on what's current state. But in many cases (2) will be violated.
 *
 *    What if we made sure that min-height is updated?
 *
 *    Now it means that (2) requirement will be satisfied for configuration 5. (not 4.).
 *    Why?
 *    Because in 5. content grows "down" (min-height has margin on the bottom).
 *    In 4. it's other way round and content grows "up".
 *
 *    Issues?
 *
 *    Only issue I see is:
 *    1. Updating min-height, but we could use strategy from 6.3. and optionally even 6.1/6.2.
 *    2. After resize, we could also find a need to update min-height. It's when content
 *       becomes bigger than min-height after resize, or will get smaller than viewport and will
 *       snap to top (by innermost sticky).
 *
 *    I think that we MUST update min-height when scroll stops. And when starts!
 *    We COULD use ResizeListener polyfill to update min-height when resizing. That'd make it 100% sure
 *    that we keep good min-height during resize.
 *
 *    There's alternative solution with top: -X, and with only 1-nesting level of sticky.
 *    But it requires updating -X value on resize.
 *
 *    HIPOTHESIS:
 *
 *    If ResizeListener is lean and lightweight, we could update Layout value (top, min-height) on
 *    every resize. That'd make everything sooo much simpler.
 *
 *    We could use top -X and have single level of sticky (no nested stickies - Edge solved).
 *
 *    We shouldn't do this onscroll. Mostly this won't be even neeed.
 *    But only on resize? Shouldn't hurt too much. If height changes it means that user
 *    makes re-layouts anyway!.
 *
 *    Problem is that ResizeListener has 20ms lag and might make layout jitter.
 *    In general, we shouln't trust polyfill in such solution.
 *    (?) Unless we play with it a little bit more. Could be solvable.
 *    (?) We could also register onResize and
 *
 *
 * 8. Triple sticky jitters on Chrome.
 *
 * 9. stickyTop could be saved somewhere. It's a nice concept of non-nested sticky that solves (1).
 *    However, it has problem on resize, should update -X parameter.
 *
 *
 *    PROBLEM SWITH CURNET SOLUTION
 *
 *    1. jittery on chrome.
 *    2. edge
 *    3. tripple sticky :(
 *
 *    (!!!) non-intrusive lightweight onREsize would solve all the problems!!!
