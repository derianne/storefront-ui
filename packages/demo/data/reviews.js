The heel is too high compared to the rest of the shoe, and almost makes me feel like I'm wearing high heels and pushes my foot forward to make them very uncomfortable. Unfortun Read More",

Opening that box, the shoe box was in mint condition as if I were to get them in store. My package showed evidence of true care while being handled, and I greatly appreciate that.

I have flat fat feet and I was able to walk all day in them. They are very light and an overall dope sneaker for the collection. I got a 1/2 size bigger just Incase but seems to run trie to size",

        "When I saw the Nike Air Max 270 React I thought what an awesome combination. React and 270 combining together is an a great idea. Once I got the shoe I was very disappointed in the comfort and what was made with the shoe. The comfort was stiff, and the transition from the heel to the toe was uncomfortable. A lot of room in the ankle area, and when walking a noticeable heel slippage. Sizing is not true to Read More",

It took a couple of wears before they settled in and got comfortable. My heel-toe transition is just fine and my diddy-bop is still on point. (They don't force me to walk funny.) An easy buy for $150.",

        'First off....these look amazing. The colors, the shape, Nike killed it.Now, tech wise? It sounds like a great idea to marry these two technologies, but they failed miserably. The main problem here is the heel-to-toe transition is clunky at best, and awful at worst. Because the Air unit is enclosed in React, there is no way to "activate" it, as React is just too soft. So you get this huge bubble on your heel, while that nice sinking feeling on the forefoot from the React. All in all, its not necessarily uncomfortable, they are just....weird.',

Plenty of toe box width and no dead space but modest heel slip going true to size. If I wasn't collecting I'd probably return these.",
